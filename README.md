This is a old joke game I wrote many years ago. Its a simple platform style game
where the user controls a guy who looks similar to mario and collects items and
avoids enemies. The project requires SDL_mixer and SDL_ttf and SDL 1.2.
The Makefile will output the SuperStoner420 directory where you can run the game.
