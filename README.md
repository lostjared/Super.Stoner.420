 * Updated


Resolved a longstanding issue and updated the feature allowing users to adjust the window size by executing:

    ./SuperStoner --size 1440 1080


This game, SuperStoner, is a humorous platformer I developed some time ago. It features gameplay where the player maneuvers a character resembling Mario, engaging in item collection and enemy avoidance. To run this project, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf, and SDL 1.2 are necessary. Compiling the game through the provided Makefile generates the SuperStoner420 directory, from which the game can be launched.

This game is just a joke, so don't take it seriously...
